# Tutorial 

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will assume the development of a tiny application. Say there's an artist who designs very fancy postcards. He sells them using the web. 

The application has only two pages. The users access an index page where they can find all the postcards. They can drag the ones they like and drop them in a selection area. Then, they click on 'Buy' and are forwarded to a form where they place contact information the artist can use to get in touch with the buyer. So, it isn't a completely automated sales process. But, it's enough for the purposes of this tutorial.
